Part 3:
(1) Read in output.parses and gold.parses and extract tree sentences as strings and add them as separate elements into output_array and test_array, respectively. 

(2) For output_array and gold_array, we collapse unary levels in each tree sentence and change the names of nodes if a word has been seen before (in that same sentence).
